# blades-in-the-dark

This repo merges my [writing](https://github.com/Nevenall/Write.git) template project with the Blades in the Dark SRD. 

- [] I plan to separate the SRD chapters into their own markdown files with normalized headers. 
- [] Not to mention getting rid of the inline html and replaced it with [remark-terms](https://github.com/Nevenall/remark-terms.git) to allow for custom spans.
- [] As time allows I'll fix/normalize other aspects of the markdown.
