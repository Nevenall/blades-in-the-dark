#Design notes and ideas

todo - what if we setup a watch task which could do an occasional git commit with info like word count?  Cory doctowrow's version is python scripts called flashbake. 
it tracks various things like weather, what you are listening too, time/timezone

todo - maybe don't want to log exact locations in public commit messages, or maybe I don't care? 

Could make all my repos private?


what about existing clones and forks?


todo - need a markdown container for inline images. 
So, we could do things like dropcaps paragraph leaders. or at least size and wrap.  
todo - maybe syntax for definition lists?
