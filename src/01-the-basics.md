# The Basics

## The Game

_Blades in the Dark_ is a game about a group of daring characters building an enterprising crew. We play to find out if the fledgling crew can thrive amidst the teeming threats that surround it.

## The Players

Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the crew to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring character who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM.

## The Characters

The characters attempt to develop their crew by performing scores and contending with threats from their enemies.

## The Crew

In addition to creating characters, you’ll also create the crew by choosing which type of criminal enterprise you’re interested in exploring.

## The Game Master

The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the non-player characters in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.

The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story and doesn’t have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.

## Playing A Session

A session of _Blades in the Dark_ is like an episode of a TV show. There are one or two main events, plus maybe some side-story elements, which all fit into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the preferences of the group.

During a session, the crew of scoundrels works together to choose a score to accomplish, then they make a few dice rolls to jump into the action of the score in progress. The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish the operation (succeed or fail). Then the crew has downtime, during which they recover, pursue side-projects, and indulge their vices. After downtime, the players once again look for a new opportunity or create their own goals and pursuits, and we play to find out what happens next.

## The Core System

### Judgment calls

When you play, you’ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:

* Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? _Can this person be swayed? Must we get out the tools and tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly finessed?_ The players have final say.
* How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? _How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot?_ The GM has final say.
* Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? _Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the constables merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped?_ The GM has final say.
* Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? _Is your character in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative?_ The GM has final say.
* Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and crew advancement? _Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? You tell us._ The players have final say.

### Rolling the Dice

_Blades in the Dark_ uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the **single highest result**.

* If the highest die is a **6**, it’s a **full success**—things go well. If you roll more than one **6**, it’s a **critical** success**—you gain some additional advantage.
* If the highest die is a **4 or 5**, that’s a **partial success**—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.
* If the highest die is **1-3**, it’s a **bad outcome**. Things go poorly. You probably don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.

_If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a **critical** when you have zero dice._

All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you’re first learning the game, you can always “collapse” back down to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.

To create a dice pool for a roll, you’ll use a **trait** (like your <span class="game-term">Finesse</span> or your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> or your crew’s Tier) and take dice equal to its **rating**. You’ll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game—a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you’ll use are the **action ratings** of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.

There are four types of rolls that you’ll use most often in the game:

* <span class="game-term">Action roll. </span>When a PC attempts an action that’s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.
* <span class="game-term">Downtime roll. </span>When the PCs are at their leisure after a job, they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.
* <span class="game-term">Fortune roll. </span>The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. _How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How much evidence is burned before the constables kick in the door?_
* <span class="game-term">Resistance roll. </span>A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don’t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. _When you resist that “Broken Leg” harm, you take some stress and now it’s only a “Sprained Ankle” instead._

### The Game Structure

_Blades in the Dark_ has a structure to play, with four parts. By default, the game is in **free play**—characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed.

When the group is ready, they choose a _target_ for their next operation, then choose a type of _plan_ to employ. This triggers the _engagement roll_ (which establishes the situation as the operation starts) and then the game shifts into the **score** phase.

During the score, the PCs engage the target—they make rolls, overcome obstacles, call for flashbacks, and complete the operation (successfully or not). When the score is finished, the game shifts into the **downtime** phase.

During the downtime phase, the GM engages the systems for _payoff_, _heat_, and _entanglements_, to determine all the fallout from the score. Then the PCs each get their _downtime activities_, such as indulging their vice to remove stress or working on a long-term project. When all the downtime activities are complete, the game returns to **free play** and the cycle starts over again.

The phases are a conceptual model to help you organize the game. They’re not meant to be rigid structures that restrict your options (this is why they’re presented as amorphous blobs of ink without hard edges). Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in play. Each phase suits a different goal.

## Actions & Attributes

### Action Ratings

There are 12 **actions** in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles.

* Attune
* Command
* Consort
* Finesse
* Hunt
* Prowl
* Skirmish
* Study
* Survey
* Sway
* Tinker
* Wreck

Each action has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don’t just represent skill or training—you’re free to describe _how_ your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at <span class="game-term">Command</span> because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing.

You choose which action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you’ll make an **action roll** to see how it turns out.

### Action Roll

You make an **action roll** when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s **position**. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. If you’re in a **controlled** position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a **desperate** position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in between, it’s **risky**—usually considered the “default” position for most actions.

If there’s no danger or trouble at hand, you don’t make an action roll. You might make a **fortune** roll or a **downtime** roll or the GM will simply say yes—and you accomplish your goal.

### Attribute Ratings

There are three **attributes** in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: <span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, and <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.

The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the **first column** under that attribute (see the examples, at right). The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.

### Resistance Roll

Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get stabbed, for example, you resist physical harm with your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating. Resistance rolls always succeed—you diminish or deflect the bad result—but the better your roll, the less **stress** it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.

When the enemy has a big advantage, you’ll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. For example, when you duel the master sword-fighter, she disarms you before you can strike. You need to make a resistance roll to keep hold of your blade if you want to attack her. Or perhaps you face a powerful ghost and attempt to <span class="game-term">Attune</span> with it to control its actions. But before you can make your own roll, you must resist possession from the spirit.

The GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “preemptive” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous foes.

For details on **Resistance Rolls**, see page 28.

@TODO Add table from page 9.

### Actions

When you <span class="game-term">Attune</span>, you open your mind to arcane power.

_You might communicate with a ghost. You could try to perceive beyond sight in order to better understand your situation (but Surveying might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Command</span>, you compel swift obedience.

_You might intimidate or threaten to get what you want. You might lead a gang in a group action. You could try to order people around to persuade them (but Consorting might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Consort</span>, you socialize with friends and contacts.

_You might gain access to resources, information, people, or places. You might make a good impression or win someone over with your charm and style. You might make new friends or connect with your heritage or background. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but Sway might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Finesse</span>, you employ dextrous manipulation or subtle misdirection.

_You might pick someone’s pocket. You might handle the controls of a vehicle or direct a mount. You might formally duel an opponent with graceful fighting arts. You could try to employ those arts in a chaotic melee (but Skirmishing might be better). You could try to pick a lock (but Tinkering might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Hunt</span>, you carefully track a target.

_You might follow a target or discover their location. You might arrange an ambush. You might attack with precision shooting from a distance. You could try to bring your guns to bear in a melee (but Skirmishing might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Prowl</span>, you traverse skillfully and quietly.

_You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You might run and leap across the rooftops. You might attack someone from hiding with a back-stab or blackjack. You could try to waylay a victim in the midst of battle (but Skirmishing might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span>, you entangle a target in close combat so they can’t easily escape.

_You might brawl or wrestle with them. You might hack and slash. You might seize or hold a position in battle. You could try to fight in a formal duel (but Finessing might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Study</span>, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.

_You might gather information from documents, newspapers, and books. You might do research on an esoteric topic. You might closely analyze a person to detect lies or true feelings. You could try to examine events to understand a pressing situation (but Surveying might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Survey</span>, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.

_You might spot telltale signs of trouble before it happens. You might uncover opportunities or weaknesses. You might detect a person’s motivations or intentions. You could try to spot a good ambush point (but Hunting might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Sway</span>, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

_You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but Consorting or Commanding might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Tinker</span>, you fiddle with devices and mechanisms.

_You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might pick a lock or crack a safe. You might disable an alarm or trap. You might turn the clockwork and electroplasmic devices around the city to your advantage. You could try to use your technical expertise to control a vehicle (but Finessing might be better)._

When you <span class="game-term">Wreck</span>, you unleash savage force.

_You might smash down a door or wall with a sledgehammer, or use an explosive to do the same. You might employ chaos or sabotage to create a distraction or overcome an obstacle. You could try to overwhelm an enemy with sheer force in battle (but Skirmishing might be better)._

As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to <span class="game-term">Wreck</span> someone during a fight? Sure! The GM tells you the position and effect level of your action in this circumstance. As it says, <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> _might_ be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won’t be better).

## Stress & Trauma

### Stress

Player characters in _Blades in the Dark_ have a special reserve called **stress**. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the **resistance roll** determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.

_During a knife fight, Daniel’s character, Cross, gets stabbed in the chest. Daniel rolls his <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating to resist, and gets a <span class="game-term">2</span>. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Daniel marks off 4 stress and describes how Cross survives._

_The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cross suffers level 2 harm (“Chest Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Punctured Lung”)._

### Pushing Yourself

You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take **2 stress** (each can be chosen once for a given action):

* Add **+1d** to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
* Add **+1 level** to your effect.
* Take action when you’re incapacitated.

### Trauma

When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of <span class="game-term">trauma</span>. When you take <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, circle one of your **trauma conditions** like _Cold_, _Reckless_, _Unstable_, etc. They’re all described on the next page.

When you suffer <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, you’re taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, **you have zero stress** and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime.

**Trauma conditions are permanent**. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. **When you mark your fourth trauma condition**, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or send them to prison to take the fall for the crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>.

#### Trauma Conditions

* <span class="game-term">Cold</span>: You’re not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.
* <span class="game-term">Haunted</span>: You’re often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.
* <span class="game-term">Obsessed</span>: You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.
* <span class="game-term">Paranoid</span>: You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others.
* <span class="game-term">Reckless</span>: You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.
* <span class="game-term">Soft</span>: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.
* <span class="game-term">Unstable</span>: Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.
* <span class="game-term">Vicious</span>: You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.

## Progress clocks

A **progress clock** is a circle divided into segments (see examples at right). Draw a progress clock when you need to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approach of impending trouble.

@TODO add clock illustration

_Sneaking into the constables watch tower? Make a clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised._

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the progress clock.

A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.

When you create a clock, make it about the **obstacle,** not the method. The clocks for an infiltration should be “Interior Patrols” and “The Tower,” not “Sneak Past the Guards” or “Climb the Tower.” The patrols and the tower are the obstacles&#173;—the PCs can attempt to overcome them in a variety of ways.

Complex enemy threats can be broken into several “layers,” each with its own progress clock. For example, the dockside gangs’ HQ might have a “Perimeter Security” clock, an “Interior Guards” clock, and a “Office Security” clock. The crew would have to make their way through all three layers to reach the gang boss’ personal safe and valuables within.

Remember that a clock tracks progress. It reflects the fictional situation, so the group can gauge how they’re doing. A clock is like a speedometer in a car. It _shows_ the speed of the vehicle—it doesn’t determine the speed.

### Simple Obstacles

Not every situation and obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex or layered and you need to track something over time—otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.

Examples of progress clocks follow.

### Danger Clocks

The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like suspicion growing during a seduction, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert level of guards on patrol. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition—the guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the hounds, etc.

### Racing Clocks

Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The PCs might have a progress clock called “Escape” while the constables have a clock called “Cornered.” If the PCs finish their clock before the constables fill theirs, they get away. Otherwise, they’re cornered and can’t flee. If both complete at the same time, the PCs escape to their lair, but the hunting officers are outside!

You can also use racing clocks for an environmental hazard. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the “Search” clock to find the lockbox on the sinking ship before the GM fills the “Sunk” clock and the vessel goes down.

### Linked Clocks

You can make a clock that unlocks another clock once it’s filled. For example, the GM might make a linked clock called “Trapped” after an “Alert” clock fills up. When you fight a veteran warrior, she might have a clock for her “Defense” and then a linked clock for “Vulnerable.” Once you overcome the “Defense” clock, then you can attempt to overcome the “Vulnerable” clock and defeat her.  You might affect the “Defense” clock with violence in a knife-fight, or you lower her defense with deception if you have the opportunity. As always, the method of action is up to the players and the details of the fiction at hand.

### Mission Clocks

The GM can make a clock for a time-sensitive mission, to represent the window of opportunity you have to complete it. If the countdown runs out, the mission is scrubbed or changes—the target escapes, the household wakes up for the day, etc.

### Tug-of-war Clocks

You can make a clock that can be filled _and_ emptied by events, to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a “Revolution!” clock that indicates when the refugees start to riot over poor treatment. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. Once it fills, the revolution begins. A tug-of-war clock is also perfect for an ongoing turf war between two crews or factions.

### Long-term Project

Some projects will take a long time. A basic long-term project (like tinkering up a new feature for a device) is eight segments. Truly long-term projects (like creating a new designer drug) can be two, three, or even four clocks, representing all the phases of development, testing, and final completion. Add or subtract clocks depending on the details of the situation and complexity of the project.

A long-term project is a good catch-all for dealing with any unusual player goal, including things that circumvent or change elements of the mechanics or the setting.

### Faction Clocks

Each faction has a long-term goal. When the PCs have **downtime**, the GM ticks forward the faction clocks that they’re interested in. In this way, the world around the PCs is dynamic and things happen that they’re not directly connected to, changing the overall situation in the city and creating new opportunities and challenges.

The PCs may also directly affect NPC faction clocks, based on the missions and scores they pull off. Discuss known faction projects that they might aid or interfere with, and also consider how a PC operation might affect the NPC clocks, whether the players intended it or not.

## Action Roll

When a player character does something challenging, we make an **action roll** to see how it turns out. An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to the PC’s goal that’s dangerous or troublesome in some way. We don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. If their action is something that we’d expect them to simply accomplish, then we don’t make an action roll.

_Each game group will have their own ideas about what “challenging” means. This is good! It’s something that establishes the tone and style of your Blades series._

To make an action roll, we go through six steps. In play, they flow together somewhat, but let’s break each one down here for clarity.

- The player states their **goal** for the action.
- The player chooses the **action rating**.
- The GM sets the **position** for the roll.
- The GM sets the **effect level** for the action.
- Add **bonus dice**.
- The player rolls the dice** and we judge the result.

### 1. The Player States Their Goal

Your goal is the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand. Usually the character’s goal is pretty obvious in context, but it’s the GM’s job to ask and clarify the goal when necessary.

_“You’re punching him in the face, right? Okay... what do want to get out of this? Do you want to take him out, or just rough him up so he’ll do what you want?”_

### 2. The Player Chooses the Action Rating

The player chooses which **action rating** to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your <span class="game-term">Command</span> action, then order someone around. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that action in the fiction.

### 3. The GM Sets the Position

Once the player chooses their action, the GM sets the **position** for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: **controlled**, **risky**, and **desperate**. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.

**By default, an action roll is risky.** You wouldn’t be rolling if there was no risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.

### 4. The GM Sets the Effect Level

The GM assesses the likely **effect level** of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us “how much” this action can accomplish: will it have **limited**, **standard**, or **great** effect?

_The GM’s choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player’s choice of action rating. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by <span class="game-term">Wrecking</span> something—well... maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn’t be crazy to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like <span class="game-term">Consorting</span> would be a lot better for that. The players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn’t mean all actions should be equally risky or potent._

### 5. Add Bonus Dice

You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll (some special abilities might give you additional bonus dice).

For one bonus die, you can get **assistance** from a teammate. They take 1 stress, say how they help you, and give you +1d.

For another bonus die, you can either **push yourself** (take 2 stress) or you can accept a **Devil’s Bargain** (you can’t get dice for both, it’s one or the other).

#### The Devil’s Bargain

PCs in _Blades_ are reckless scoundrels addicted to destructive vices—they don’t always act in their own best interests. To reflect this, the GM or any other player can offer you a bonus die if you accept a Devil’s Bargain. Common Devil’s Bargains include:

* Collateral damage, unintended harm.
* Sacrifice <span class="game-term">coin</span> or an item.
* Betray a friend or loved one.
* Offend or anger a faction.
* Start and/or tick a troublesome clock.
* Add <span class="game-term">heat</span> to the crew from evidence or witnesses.
* Suffer harm.

The Devil’s Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die.

The Devil’s Bargain is always a free choice. If you don’t like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead.

If it’s ever needed, the GM has final say over which Devil’s Bargains are valid.

### 6. Roll the Dice and Judge the Result

Once the goal, action rating, position, and effect have been established, add any bonus dice and roll the dice pool to determine the outcome. (See the sets of possible outcomes, by position, on the next page.)

The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well the character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a <span class="game-term">6</span>), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>), or it might just all go wrong (on a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>).

On a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>, it’s up to the GM to decide if the PC’s action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a <span class="game-term">1-3</span> result.

Each <span class="game-term">4/5</span> and <span class="game-term">1-3</span> outcome lists suggested **consequences** for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these consequences, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by **resisting** them.

When you narrate the action after the roll, the GM and player collaborate together to say what happens on-screen. _Tell us how you vault across to the other rooftop. Tell us what you say to the Inspector to convince her. The GM will tell us how she reacts. When you face the Red Sash duelist, what’s your fighting style like? Etc._

### Action Roll Summary

* A player or GM calls for a roll. Make an **action roll** when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.
* The player chooses the **action rating** to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.
* The GM establishes the **position** and **effect level** of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action.
* Add up to two bonus dice. 1) **Assistance** from a teammate. 2) **Push yourself** (take 2 stress) or accept a **Devil’s Bargain**.
* Roll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.

### Double-duty Rolls

Since NPCs don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: **it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved**. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a <span class="game-term">6</span>, the PC wins and has their effect. On a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>, it’s a mix—both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a <span class="game-term">1-3</span>, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.

@TODO add Action Roll table p21

## Effect

In _Blades in the Dark_, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the **effect level** of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand&#173;&#173;—**great**, **standard**, or **limited**? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a **progress clock**.

@TODO add fancy effect levels p23.

### Assessing Factors

To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: **potency**, **scale**, and **quality**. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.

#### Potency

The potency factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk, or the influence of arcane powers. An infiltrator is more potent if all the lights are extinguished and they move about in the dark.

#### Quality/Tier

Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by Tier. **Fine items** count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier.

_Thorn is picking the lock to a safehouse run of a gang reknowned for Occult dealings. Her crew is Tier I and she has fine lockpicks—so she’s effectively Tier II. The Occult gang is Tier III. Thorn is outclassed in quality, so her effect will be limited on the lock._

#### Scale

Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.

When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in **zero effect**—or increased beyond great, resulting in an **extreme effect**.

If a PC special ability gives “+1 effect,” it comes into play _after_ the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Cutter’s <span class="game-term">Bodyguard</span> ability would bump them up to limited effect.

Also, remember that a PC can **push themselves** (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action.

Every factor won’t always apply to every situation. You don’t have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call—don’t feel beholden to them.

### Trading Position for Effect

After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they’re going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect.

This kind of trade-off isn’t included in the effect factors because it’s not an element the GM should assess when setting the effect level. Once the level is set, though, you can always offer the trade-off to the player if it makes sense in the situation.

_“I Prowl across the courtyard and vault over the wall, hiding in the shadows by the canal dock and gondola.”_

_“I don’t think you can make it across in one quick dash. The scale of the courtyard is a factor here, so your effect will be limited. Let’s say you can get halfway across with this action, then you’ll have to Prowl through the other half of the space (and the rest of the guards there) to reach the other side.”_

_“I didn’t realize it was that far. Hmmm. Okay, what if I just go as fast as I can. Can I get all the way across if I make a desperate roll?”_

_“Yep, sounds good to me!”_

### Consequences

When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it’s called a **consequence**. Consequences are the companion to effects. PCs have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face.

## Setting Position & Effect

The GM sets position and effect for an action roll at the same time, after the player says what they’re doing and chooses their action. Usually, **Risky / Standard** is the default combination, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and the effect factors.

The ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances.

_For example, if a character is facing off alone against a small enemy gang, the situation might be:_

* _She fights the gang straight up, rushing into their midst, hacking away in a wild _<span class="game-term">Skirmish</span>_. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the gang reduces her effect (Desperate / Limited)._
* _She fights the gang from a choke-point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can’t overwhelm her at once. She’s not threatened by several at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there’s still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced (Risky / Limited)._
* _She doesn’t fight the gang, instead trying to maneuver her way past them and escape. She’s still under threat from many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the gang can’t easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn’t reduced (Desperate / Standard). If she had some immediate means of escape (like leaping onto a speeding carriage), then her effect might even be increased (Desperate / Great)._
* _The gang isn’t aware of her yet—she’s set up in a sniper position on a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren’t a factor, so her effect isn’t reduced, and she’s not immediately in any danger (Controlled / Great). Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole gang, in which case their scale applies (Controlled / Limited). If the gang is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous (Risky / Great). If the gang is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover (Risky / Limited). If the gang is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our scoundrel (Desperate / Limited)._

## Consequences and Harm

Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict **consequences** on a PC. There are five types (at right).

A given circumstance might result in one or more consequences, depending on the situation. The GM determines the consequences, following from the fiction and the style and tone established by the game group.

### Reduced Effect

This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as they’d anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.

### Complication

This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action right now: the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the crew takes +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> from evidence or witnesses, you lose status with a faction, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, etc.

Or the GM might tick a clock for the complication, instead. Maybe there’s a clock for the alert level of the guards at the manor. Or maybe the GM creates a new clock for the suspicion of the noble guests at the masquerade party and ticks it. Fill one tick on a clock for a minor complication or two ticks for a standard complication.

A **serious complication** is more severe: reinforcements surround and trap you, the room catches fire and falling ceiling beams block the door, your weapon is broken, the crew suffers +2 <span class="game-term">heat</span>, your target escapes out of sight, etc. Fill three ticks on a clock for a serious complication.

**Don’t inflict a complication that negates a successful roll.** If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>, don’t say that the enemy escapes. The player’s roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered... maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.

### Lost Opportunity

This consequence represents shifting circumstance. You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slips away. To try again, you need a new approach—usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe you tried to <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> with the noble to trap her on the balcony, but she evades your maneuver and leaps out of reach. If you want to trap her now you’ll have to try another way—maybe by <span class="game-term">Swaying</span> her with your roguish charm.

### Worse Position

This consequence represents losing control of the situation—the action carries you into a more dangerous position. Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position. This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from controlled, to risky, to desperate as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper in trouble.

### Harm

This consequence represents a long-lasting debility (or death). When you suffer harm, record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer. If you suffer** lesser harm**, record it in the bottom row. If you suffer **moderate harm**, write it in the middle row. If you suffer **severe harm**, record it in the top row. See examples of harm and the harm tracker, below.

Your character suffers the penalty indicated at the end of the row if any or all harm recorded in that row applies to the situation at hand. So, if you have “Drained” and “Battered” harm in the bottom row, you’ll suffer reduced effect when you try to run away from the constables. When you’re impaired by harm in the top row (severe harm, level 3), your character is incapacitated and can’t do anything unless you have help from someone else or **push yourself** to perform the action.

If you need to mark a harm level, but the row is already filled, the harm moves up to the next row above. So, if you suffered standard harm (level 2) but had no empty spaces in the second row, you’d have to record severe harm (level 3), instead. If you run out of spaces on the top row and need to mark harm there, your character suffers a **catastrophic, permanent consequence** (loss of a limb, sudden death, etc., depending on the circumstances).

@TODO Table from p27


#### Harm examples

**Fatal (4):** _Electrocuted, Drowned, Stabbed in the Heart._

**Severe (3):** _Impaled, Broken Leg, Shot in Chest, Badly Burned, Terrified._

**Moderate (2):** _Exhausted, Deep Cut to Arm, Concussion, Panicked, Seduced._

**Lesser (1):** _Battered, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused._

Harm like “Drained” or “Exhausted” can be a good fallback consequence if there’s nothing else threatening a PC (like when they spend all night <span class="game-term">Studying</span> those old books, looking for any clues to their enemy’s weaknesses before he strikes).

## Resistance and Armor

When your PC suffers a consequence that you don’t like, you can choose to resist it. Just tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” Resistance is always automatically effective—the GM will tell you if the consequence is reduced in severity or if you avoid it entirely. Then, you’ll make a **resistance roll** to see how much stress your character suffers as a result of their resistance.

You make the roll using one of your character’s **attributes** (<span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, or <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>). The GM chooses the attribute, based on the nature of consequences:

* <span class="game-term">Insight</span>: Consequences from deception or understanding.
* <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>: Consequences from physical strain or injury.
* <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.

Your character suffers **6 stress** when they resist, **minus the highest die result from the resistance roll**. So, if you rolled a <span class="game-term">4</span>, you’d suffer 2 stress. If you rolled a <span class="game-term">6</span>, you’d suffer zero stress. If you get a <span class="game-term">critical</span> result, you also **clear 1 stress**.

> Ian’s character, Silas, is in a desperate <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> with several duelists and one of them lands a blow with their sword. Since the position was desperate, the GM inflicts severe harm (modified by any other factors). They tell Ian to record level 3 harm, “Gut Stabbed” on Silas’s sheet. Ian decides to resist the harm, instead. The GM says he can reduce the harm by one level if he resists it. Ian rolls 3d for Silas’s <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> attribute and gets a <span class="game-term">5</span>. Silas takes 1 stress and the harm is reduced to level 2, “Cut to the Ribs.”

Usually, a resistance roll **reduces the severity** of a consequence. If you’re going to suffer fatal harm, for example, a resistance roll would reduce the harm to severe, instead. Or if you got a complication when you were sneaking into the manor house, and the GM was going to mark three ticks on the “Alert” clock, she’d only mark two (or maybe one) if you resisted the complication.

**You may only roll against a given consequence once.**

The GM also has the option to rule that your character **completely avoids** the consequence. For instance, maybe you’re in a sword fight and the consequence is getting disarmed. When you resist, the GM says that you avoid that consequence completely: you keep hold of your weapon.

**By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of your game**. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance.

The GM may also threaten several consequences at once, then the player may choose which ones to resist (and make rolls for each).

> “She stabs you and then leaps off the balcony. Level 2 harm and you lose the opportunity to catch her with fighting.”

> “I’ll resist losing the opportunity by grappling her as she attacks. She can stab me, but I don’t want to let her escape.”

Once you decide to resist a consequence and roll, you suffer the stress indicated. You can’t roll first and see how much stress you’ll take, then decide whether or not to resist.

@TODO add table p29

### Armor

If you have a type of **armor** that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.

> Silas is taking level 2 harm, “Cut to the Ribs,” and the fight isn’t even over yet, so Ian decides to use Silas’s armor to reduce the harm. He marks the armor box and the harm becomes level 1, “Bruised.” If Silas was wearing heavy armor, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero.

When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your **load** for the next score.

### Death

There are a couple ways for a PC to die:

* If they suffer level 4 fatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. _Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here._
* If they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they suffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).

When your character dies, you have options:

* You can create a new scoundrel to play. Maybe you “promote” one of the NPC gang members to a PC, or create a brand new character who joins the crew.

## Fortune Roll

The fortune roll is a tool the GM can use to disclaim decision making. You use a fortune roll in two different ways:

**When you need to make a determination about a situation the PCs aren’t directly involved in** and don’t want to simply decide the outcome.

> Two rival gands are fighting. How does that turn out? The GM makes a fortune roll for each of them. One gets a good result but the other gets limited effect. The GM decides that the first gang takes over some of their rivals’ turf but suffer some injuries during the skirmish.

**When an outcome is uncertain**, but no other roll applies to the situation at hand.

> While pilfering the workshop of an alchemist, Cross is possessed by a vengeful ghost. As control of his body slips away, Cross grabs a random potion bottle and drinks it down. Will the arcane concoction have an effect on the spirit? Will it poison Nock to death? Who knows? The GM makes a fortune roll to see how it turns out.

When you make a fortune roll you may assess **any trait rating** to determine the dice pool of the roll.

* When a faction takes an action with uncertain outcome, you might use their **Tier** rating to make a fortune roll.
* When a gang operates independently, use their **quality** rating for a fortune roll.
* When a supernatural power manifests with uncertain results, you might use its **magnitude** for a fortune roll.
* When a PC **gathers information**, you might make a fortune roll using their **action rating** to determine the amount of the info they get.

If no trait applies, roll 1d for sheer luck or create a dice pool (from one to four) based on the situation at hand. If two parties are directly opposed, make a fortune roll for each side to see how they do, then assess the outcome of the situation by comparing their performance levels.

The fortune roll is also a good tool to help the GM manage all the various moving parts of the world. Sometimes a quick roll is enough to answer a question or inspire an idea for what might happen next.

Other examples of fortune rolls:

* The PCs instigate a war between two factions, then sit back and watch the fireworks. How does it turn out? Does either side dominate? Are they both made vulnerable by the conflict? Make a few fortune rolls to find out.
* A strange sickness is sweeping the city. How badly is a crime ridden district hit by the outbreak? The GM assigns a magnitude to the arcane plague, and makes a fortune roll to judge the extent of its contamination.
* The Hound stakes out a good spot and makes a sniper shot against a gang leader when he enters his office. The controlled <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> roll is a success, but is great effect enough to instantly kill a grizzled gang leader? Instead of making a progress clock for his mortality, the GM decides to use a simple fortune roll with his “toughness” as a trait to see if he can possibly survive the attack. The roll is a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>: the bullet misses his heart, but hits him in the lung—it’s a mortal wound. He’s on death’s door, with only hours to live, unless his gang can get an expert physicker to him in time.
* Inspectors are putting a case together against the PC crew. How quickly will their evidence result in arrests? The crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> counts as a major advantage for the inspectors.
* The PCs face off in a skirmish with a veteran demon hunter captain and her crew. The tide of battle goes in the PCs’ favor, and many crew members are killed. One of the players asks if the captain will surrender to spare the rest of her crew’s lives. The GM isn’t sure. How cold-hearted is this veteran hunter? She’s stared giant demons in the eye without flinching... is there anything human left inside her? The GM makes a 2d fortune roll for “human feelings” to see if a spark of compassion remains in heart. If so, maybe one of the PCs can roll to <span class="game-term">Consort</span>, <span class="game-term">Sway</span>, or <span class="game-term">Command</span> her to stand down.

@TODO table p31

## Gathering Information

The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say _everything_—it would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.

When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can **gather information**. The GM will ask you **how** your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).

If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.

Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.

Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.

The most common gather information actions are <span class="game-term">Surveying</span> the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on and <span class="game-term">Studying</span> a person to understand what they intend to do or what they’re really thinking.

Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to <span class="game-term">Prowl</span> to a good hiding place first and then <span class="game-term">Study</span> the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.

### Investigation

Some questions are too complex to answer immediately with a single gather information roll. For instance, you might want to discover the network of contraband smuggling routes in the city. In these cases, the GM will tell you to start a **long-term project** that you work on during **downtime**.

You track the investigation project using a progress clock. Once the clock is filled, you have the evidence you need to ask several questions about the subject of your investigation as if you had great effect.

### Examples &amp; Questions

* You might <span class="game-term">Attune</span> to see echoes of recent spirit activity. _Have any new ghosts been here? How can I find the spirit well that’s calling to them? What should I be worried about?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Command</span> a local barkeep to tell you what he knows about the secret meetings held in his back room. _What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Consort</span> with a well-connected friend to learn secrets about an enemy, rival, or potential ally. _What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives? How can I discover leverage to manipulate them?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> a courier across the city, to discover who’s receiving satchels of coin from a master duelsit. _Where does the package end up? How can I find out who signed for the package at City Hall?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Study</span> ancient and obscure books to discover an arcane secret. _How can I disable the runes of warding? __Will anyone sense if they’re disabled?_
* Or you might <span class="game-term">Study</span> a person to read their intentions and feelings. _What are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a manor house to case it for a heist. _What’s a good point of infiltration? What’s the danger here?_
* Or you might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a charged situation when you meet another gang. _What’s really going on here? Are they about to attack us?_
* You might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> a powerful lord at a party so he divulges his future plans. _What does he intend to do? How can I get him to think I might be a good partner in this venture?_
* Or you might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> his bodyguard to confide in you about recent events. _Where has he been lately? Who’s he been meeting with?_

@TODO table p33

## Coin and Stash

### Coin

<span class="game-term">Coin</span> is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets.

The few bits PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to spend to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC’s **lifestyle quality** for a fortune roll.

### Monetary values

* <span class="game-term">1 coin: </span>A full purse of silver pieces. A week’s wages.
* <span class="game-term">2 coin:</span> A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.
* <span class="game-term">4 coin:</span> A satchel full of silver. A month’s wages.
* <span class="game-term">6 coin:</span> An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.
* <span class="game-term">8 coin:</span> A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.
* <span class="game-term">10 coin:</span> Liquidating a significant asset—a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.

More than 4<span class="game-term">coin</span> is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your **stash** (see below). A crew can also store 4<span class="game-term CharOverride-5"> </span><span class="game-term">coin</span> in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a **vault**, they can expand their stores to <span class="game-term CharOverride-15">8</span> and then 16 <span class="game-term">coin</span>. Any <span class="game-term">coin</span> beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the crew members.

One unit of <span class="game-term">coin</span> in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your **load** when carried.

#### Coin Use

* Spend 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span> to get an additional **activity** during **downtime**.
* Spend 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span> to increase the result level of a **downtime activity** roll.
* Spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> to avoid certain crew **entanglements**.
* Put <span class="game-term">coin</span> in your character’s **stash** to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next page.
* Spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> when you advance your crew’s **Tier**.

### Stash &amp; Retirement

When you mark your character’s final <span class="game-term">trauma</span> and they retire, the amount of <span class="game-term">coin</span> they’ve managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet.

* **Stash 0-10:** **Poor soul. **You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.
* **Stash 11-20: Meager.** A tiny hovel that you can call your own.
* **Stash 21-39: Modest.** A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.
* **Stash 40: Fine.** A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.

In addition, each full row of stash (10 <span class="game-term">coins</span>) indicates the **quality level of the character’s lifestyle**, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).

> Cross wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but he can’t take them back to the hidden lair where he lives, so what to do? Ryan, Cross’s player, says he wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Cross’s lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Cross can manage.

#### Removing coin from your stash

If you want to pull <span class="game-term">coin</span> out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. **For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 **<span class="game-term">coin</span>** in cash.**

## The Faction Game

### Tier

Each notable faction is ranked by **Tier**—a measure of wealth, influence, and scale. At the highest level are the Tier V and VI factions, the true powers of the city. Your crew begins at Tier 0.

You’ll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your crew’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the **quality level** of your items as well as the quality and **scale** of the gangs your crew employs—and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.

#### Gang scale by tier

* <span class="game-term">tier v</span>. Massive gangs. (80 people)
* <span class="game-term">tier iv</span>. Huge gangs. (40 people)
* <span class="game-term">tier iii</span>. Large gangs. (20 people)
* <span class="game-term">tier ii</span>. Medium gangs. (12 people)
* <span class="game-term">tier i</span>. Small gangs. (3-6 people)
* <span class="game-term">tier 0</span>. 1 or 2 people

### Hold

On the faction ladder next to the Tier numbers is a letter indicating the strength of each faction’s **hold**. Hold represents how well a faction can maintain their current position on the ladder. W indicates **weak** hold. S indicates **strong** hold. Your crew begins with **strong** hold at **Tier 0**.

### Development

To move up the ladder and develop your crew, you need <span class="game-term">rep</span>. <span class="game-term">Rep</span> is a measure of clout and renown. When you accrue enough <span class="game-term">rep</span>, the other factions take you more seriously and you attract the support needed to develop and grow.

When you complete a score, your crew earns **2 **<span class="game-term">rep</span>. If the target of the score is higher Tier than your crew, you get **+1 **<span class="game-term">rep</span>** per Tier higher**. If the target of the score is lower Tier, you get **-1 <span class="game-term">rep</span>** per Tier lower** (minimum zero).

You need **12 <span class="game-term">rep</span>** to fill the <span class="game-term">rep</span> tracker on your crew sheet. When you fill the tracker, do one of the following:

* If your hold is weak, it becomes strong. **Reset your **<span class="game-term">rep</span>** to zero**.
* If your hold is strong, you can pay to increase your crew Tier by one. This costs <span class="game-term">coin</span> equal to your **new Tier x 8**. As long as your <span class="game-term">rep</span> tracker is full, you don’t earn new <span class="game-term">rep</span> (12 is the max). Once you pay and increase your Tier, **reset your **<span class="game-term">rep</span>** to zero** and **reduce your hold to weak**.

### Turf

Another way to contribute to the crew’s development is by acquiring **turf**. When you seize and hold territory, you establish a more stable basis for your <span class="game-term">rep</span>. Each piece of turf that you claim represents abstracted support for the crew (often a result of the fear you instill in the citizens on that turf).

Turf is marked on your <span class="game-term">rep</span> tracker (see the example below). Each piece of turf you hold reduces the <span class="game-term">rep</span> cost to develop by one. So, if you have 2 turf, you need 10 <span class="game-term">rep</span> to develop. If you have 4 turf, you need 8 <span class="game-term">rep</span> to develop. **You can hold a maximum of 6 turf.** When you develop and reset your <span class="game-term">rep</span>, **you keep the marks from all the turf you hold.**

@TODO table p37

Also, when you acquire turf, you expand the scope of your crew’s **hunting grounds**.

#### Reducing hold

You may perform an operation specifically to reduce the hold of another faction, if you know how they’re vulnerable. If the operation succeeds, the target faction loses 1 level of hold. If their hold is weak and it drops, the faction loses 1 Tier and stays weak.

When a faction is at war, it temporarily loses 1 hold.

Your crew can lose hold, too, following the same rules above. If your crew is Tier 0, with weak hold, and you lose hold for any reason, your lair comes under threat by your enemies or by a faction seeking to profit from your misfortune.

### Faction Status

Your crew’s **status** with each faction indicates how well you are liked or hated. Status is rated from -3 to +3, with zero (neutral) being the default starting status. You track your status with each faction on the faction sheet.

When you create your crew, you assign some positive and negative status ratings to reflect recent history. The ratings will then change over time based on your actions in play.

#### Faction status changes

When you execute an operation, you gain -1 or -2 status with factions that are hurt by your actions. You may also gain +1 status with a faction that your operation helps. (If you keep your operation completely quiet then your status doesn’t change.) Your status may also change if you do a favor for a faction or if you refuse one of their demands.

#### Faction status levels

* **+3: **Allies**. This faction will help you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same for them.
* **+2: **Friendly**.** This faction will help you if it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same.
* **+1: **Helpful**.** This faction will help you if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.
* **0: **Neutral**
* **-1: **Interfering**.** This faction will look for opportunities to cause trouble for you (or profit from your misfortune) as long as it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.
* **-2: **Hostile**.** This faction will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you.
* **-3: **War**.** This faction will go out of its way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you. When you’re at war with any number of factions, your crew suffers +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> from scores, temporarily loses 1 hold, and PCs get only one downtime action rather than two. You can end a war by eliminating your enemy or by negotiating a mutual agreement to establish a new status rating.

> If your crew has weak hold when you go to war, the temporary loss of hold causes you to lose one Tier. When the war is over, restore your crew’s Tier back to its pre-war level.

### Claims

Each crew sheet has a map of claims available to be seized. The claim map displays a default roadmap for your crew type. Claims should usually be seized in an orderly sequence, by following the paths from the central square, the crew’s lair.

_However, you may attempt to seize any claim on your map_, ignoring the paths (or even seek out a special claim not on your map) but these operations will always be especially difficult and require exceptional efforts to discover and achieve.

#### Seizing a claim

Every claim is already controlled by a faction. To acquire one for yourself, you have to take it from someone else. To seize a claim, tell the GM which claim on your map your crew intends to capture. The GM will detail the claim with a location and a description and will tell you which faction currently controls that claim. Or the GM might offer you a choice of a few options if they’re available.

If you choose to ignore the roadmap paths when seizing a claim, the GM might tell you that you’ll need to investigate and gather information in order to discover a claim of that type before you can attempt to seize it.

Execute the operation like any other **score**, and if you succeed, you seize the claim and the targeted faction loses the claim.

Seizing a claim is a serious attack on a faction, usually resulting in -2 faction status with the target, and potentially +1 status with its enemies.

As soon as you seize a claim, you enjoy the listed benefit for as long as you hold the claim. Some claims count as **turf**. Others provide special benefits to the crew, such as bonus dice in certain circumstances, extra <span class="game-term">coin</span> generated for the crew’s treasury, or new opportunities for action.

#### Losing a claim

An enemy faction may try to seize a claim that your crew holds. You can fight to defend it, or negotiate a deal with the faction, depending on the situation. If you lose a claim, you lose all the benefits of that claim. If your lair is lost, you lose the benefits of all of your claims until you can restore your lair or establish a new one. To restore or establish a new lair, accomplish a score to do so.

## Advancement

### PC Advancement

Each player keeps track of the experience points (**xp**) that their character earns.

During the game session, mark xp:

* When you make a **desperate action roll**. Mark 1 xp in the attribute for the action you rolled. For example, if you roll a desperate <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> action, you mark xp in <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>_._ When you roll in a **group action** that’s desperate, you also mark xp.

At the end of the session, review the **xp triggers** on your character sheet. For each one, mark 1 xp if it happened at all, or mark 2 xp if it happened a lot during the session. The xp triggers are:

* **Your playbook-specific xp trigger**. For example, the Cutter’s is _“Address a challenge with violence or coercion.”_ To “address a challenge,” your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn’t matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.
* **You expressed your beliefs, drives, heritage, or background.** Your character’s beliefs and drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.
* **You struggled with issues from your vice or traumas**. Mark xp for this if your vice tempted you to some bad action or if a trauma condition caused you trouble. Simply indulging your vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you **overindulge**).


You may mark end-of-session xp on any xp tracks you want (any attribute or your playbook xp track).

When you fill an xp track, clear all the marks and take an **advance**. When you take an advance from your playbook track, you may choose an additional **special ability**. When you take an advance from an attribute, you may add an **additional action dot** to one of the actions under that attribute.

> Nadja is playing a Hound. At the end of the session, she reviews her xp triggers and tells the group how much xp she’s getting. She rolled two desperate <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> actions during the session, so she marked 2 xp on her <span class="game-term">Insight</span> xp track. She addressed several challenges with tracking or violence, so she marks 2 xp for that. She expressed her Iruvian heritage many times when dealing with the Red Sashes, so she takes 2 xp for that. She also showcased her character’s beliefs, but 2 xp is the maximum for that category, so she doesn’t get any more. She didn’t struggle with her vice or traumas, so no xp there. That’s 4 xp at the end of the session. She decides to put it all in her <span class="game-term">Insight</span> xp track. This fills the track, so she adds a new action dot in <span class="game-term">Hunt</span>.

You can also earn xp by **training** during downtime. When you train, mark xp in one of your attributes or in your playbook. A given xp track can be trained only once per downtime phase.

### Crew Advancement

At the end of the session, review the crew xp triggers and mark 1 crew xp for each item that occurred during the session. If an item occurred multiple times or in a major way, mark 2 crew xp for it. The crew xp triggers are:

* **Your crew-specific xp trigger**. For example, the Smugglers’ is _“Execute a smuggling operation or acquire new clients or contraband sources.”_ If the crew successfully completed an operation from this trigger, mark xp.
* **Contend with challenges above your current station.** If you tangled with higher Tiers or more dangerous opposition, mark xp for this.
* **Bolster your crew’s reputation or develop a new one.** Review your crew’s reputation. Did you do anything to promote it? Also mark xp if you developed a new reputation for the crew.
* **Express the goals, drives, inner conflict, or essential nature of the crew.** This one is very broad! Essentially, did anything happen that highlighted the specific elements that make your crew unique?


**When you fill your crew advancement tracker**, clear the marks and take a new **special ability **or mark **two crew upgrade boxes**.

> For example, when a crew of Assassins earns a crew advance, they could take a new special ability, like **Predators**. Or they could mark two upgrades, like **Ironhook Contacts** and **Resolve** **Training**.

Say how you’ve obtained this new ability or upgrades for the crew. _Where did it come from? How does it become a new part of the crew?_

#### Profits

Every time the crew advances, **each PC gets** **s**tash** equal to the crew Tier+2, to represent profits generated by the crew as they’ve been operating.
